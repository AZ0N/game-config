# CS:GO Config

## Launch options
```csgo launch options
-tickrate 128 -novid -nojoy
```

## Config file
The CS:GO config file should be placed at either:
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\{STEAM_ID}\730\local\cfg\` or
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\`

When named [autoexec.cfg](autoexec.cfg) the config should execute automatically evey time the game opens.

My previous config is given in [autoexec.old.cfg](autoexec.old.cfg), however some of the setting are no longer in the game.

## Sensitivity
DPI: **450**

CS:GO Sens: **1.9**
